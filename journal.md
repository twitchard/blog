# The Journal
This page is where I collect scattered thoughts about (software-related) things, especially things I read or videos I watch.

In a way, this is my real "blog" (i.e. "web log"). The "posts" on my "blog" are really more like essays. Not off the cuff.


## What I'm interested in these days (2022-07-06)

For some while I've been interested in exploring a somewhat vague vision I have for a tool to build web apps by describing user goals instead of user interfaces -- i.e. instead of saying "there's a text field and a button labeled "send" hooked up to POST /tweet" you would say "users want to send tweets with text", or instead of saying "there's a timeline of tweets and tweets have a retweet icon hooked up to POST /retweet/{id}", you would say "users want to discover tweets from those they follow and retweet those tweets"

So towards this, I'm interested in

* Linear logic -- I think this might be a good way to express the interplay between user goals and user interfaces. 
* Program synthesis -- Program synthesis, i.e. searching for a program that satisfies a specification, is a more general instance of "generate a web app that satisfies a specification of user goals".
* Programming languages -- The people studying linear logic and program synthesis mostly seem to be academic PL researchers who use jargon like "operational semantics" and whose papers are like 30% weird logic symbols stacked atop horizontal lines. Just generally I'd like to become more fluent with that sort of thing.
